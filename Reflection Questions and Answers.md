Reflection Questions and Answers

1. What does the Detection Zone simulate in a “smart environment”?

The Detection Zone simulates a smart sensor area in a real environment, similar to motion detectors or proximity sensors that react when a person enters a specific space. It creates the feeling that the environment is aware of the player’s presence and can respond automatically.

2. How does the NPC decide when to move?

The NPC decides to move by constantly checking the distance between itself and the player. When the player comes within the defined chaseDistance, the NPC rotates toward the player and starts moving forward, which makes it look like a simple AI reaction based on proximity.

3. What changes made the environment feel more responsive?

The environment felt more responsive after adding trigger-based events like light color changes, sound alerts, and NPC movement. Especially the instant feedback when entering or exiting the Detection Zone made the scene feel more interactive and alive.

4. If you had real AI, what would you improve in this scene?

If I had real AI, I would improve the NPC behavior by adding more intelligent decision-making, such as pathfinding, obstacle avoidance, and different reactions based on player actions. I would also make the environment adapt dynamically, for example adjusting lighting or sound intensity based on player behavior instead of just simple triggers.
